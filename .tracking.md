# Bump App Development Tracking

## Project Overview
Bump is an app designed to enhance spontaneous in-person connections by helping users bump into friends at their favorite gathering spots. The app enables sharing of hangout locations, real-time status updates, and logging of serendipitous meetups.

## Current State

2. **Theming System**
   - Created a comprehensive theme file with colors, typography, spacing, etc.
   - Implemented ThemeContext and ThemeProvider for consistent styling
   - Added animations.css with various animation classes
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for the theme to prevent property access errors
   - Enhanced theme with derived color variables for better consistency

3. **Core UI Components**
   - Navigation component with animated icons and mobile-friendly design

   - Fixed Button component theme property access (spacing → space)
   - Fixed React DOM warnings about unrecognized props by using transient props ($fullWidth, $iconPosition) in Button component
   - Fixed theme property access in Home component (spacing → space, borderRadius → radii)

5. **Authentication & Database**
   - Set up Supabase authentication with login/signup functionality
   - Created AuthContext for managing user state throughout the app
   - Implemented protected routes for authenticated users
   - Defined database schema with tables for users, places, statuses, friends, meetups, and settings
   - Set up Row Level Security policies for data protection
   - Configured local Supabase instance for development

6. **Home Page & Check-In**
   - Enhanced Home page with better UI and animations
   - Implemented status grouping by place with counts
   - Added loading states and empty state handling
   - Created CheckInForm with place selection and privacy options
