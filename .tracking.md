# Bump App Development Tracking

## Project Status

We are building the Bump app according to the PRD, which is a social app designed to enhance spontaneous in-person connections by helping users bump into friends at their favorite gathering spots.

## Current Progress

### Initial Setup
- Created a React/Vite project with TypeScript
- Set up Supabase for the backend
- Created the initial database schema in `supabase/migrations/20250302013958_initial_schema.sql`
- Set up basic authentication with Supabase Auth

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed issues with Supabase queries for user data:
  - Modified `getActiveStatuses()` function to manually fetch and attach user data instead of using Supabase's join syntax
  - Modified `getFriends()` function to manually fetch and attach user data instead of using Supabase's join syntax
  - Updated the `Status` and `Friend` interfaces in `src/types/index.ts` to use `users_view` instead of `users`/`friend`
  - Updated the `StatusCard` and `FriendCard` components to use the new field names

## Next Steps
- Continue implementing the core features according to the PRD
- Test the application to ensure all functionality works as expected
- Implement the remaining screens and components
