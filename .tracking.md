# Bump App Development Tracking

## Project Status

We are building the Bump app according to the PRD, which is a social app designed to enhance spontaneous in-person connections by helping users bump into friends at their favorite gathering spots.

## Current Progress

### Initial Setup
- Created a React/Vite project with TypeScript
- Set up Supabase for the backend
- Created the initial database schema in `supabase/migrations/20250302013958_initial_schema.sql`
- Set up basic authentication with Supabase Auth

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue with the Supabase query in `getActiveStatuses()` function. The query was trying to join the `statuses` table with a non-existent `users` table. Updated it to use the `users_view` view instead.
- Updated the `Status` interface in `src/types/index.ts` to use `users_view` instead of `users`.
- Updated the `StatusCard` component to use `status.users_view` instead of `status.users`.

## Next Steps
- Continue implementing the core features according to the PRD
- Test the application to ensure all functionality works as expected
- Implement the remaining screens and components
