# Bump App Development Tracking

## Project Status

We are building the Bump app according to the PRD, which is a social app designed to enhance spontaneous in-person connections by helping users bump into friends at their favorite gathering spots.

## Current Progress

### Initial Setup
- Created a React/Vite project with TypeScript
- Set up Supabase for the backend
- Created the initial database schema in `supabase/migrations/20250302013958_initial_schema.sql`
- Set up basic authentication with Supabase Auth

### Core Features Implementation
- Implemented Home page with check-in functionality and real-time status updates
- Implemented Places page for managing favorite gathering spots
- Implemented Friends page with "Intend to Bump" functionality
- Implemented Meetups page with ability to log encounters and view history
- Implemented basic Settings page

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed issues with Supabase queries for user data:
  - Modified `getActiveStatuses()` function to manually fetch and attach user data instead of using Supabase's join syntax
  - Modified `getFriends()` function to manually fetch and attach user data instead of using Supabase's join syntax
  - Updated the `Status` and `Friend` interfaces in `src/types/index.ts` to use `users_view` instead of `users`/`friend`
  - Updated the `StatusCard` and `FriendCard` components to use the new field names
- Fixed WebSocket connection issues with local Supabase instance:
  - Updated the anon key in `.env.local` to match the one from the local Supabase instance
  - Enhanced Supabase client configuration with explicit WebSocket and authentication options
- Fixed TypeScript build errors:
  - Removed unused `Label` styled component in `AddFriendForm.tsx`
  - Removed unused `useRef` import in `PlaceForm.tsx`
  - Removed unused `FaTrash` import in `Places.tsx`
  - Removed unused type imports in `supabase.ts`

### Recent Implementations
- Implemented notification system for friend check-ins:
  - Created `NotificationContext` to manage notifications
  - Added `NotificationBell` component to display notifications
  - Updated Settings page to include notification preferences
  - Added "Do Not Disturb" toggle in Settings
  - Added test notification button on Home page for demonstration

## Next Steps
- Add statistics to the Meetups page (e.g., "3 meetups this month")
- Configure PWA settings for offline access
- Polish UI and add animations
- Deploy to Vercel with Supabase connection
